# CS50AI-Project4-Shopping

My solution for CS50AI Project 4 - Shopping.

Using the scikit-learn package and historical data of the browsing information of visitors to a website, including whether they made a purchase, this AI is able to predict whether a new visitor will make a purchase. 

By splitting the data into training and testing sets, and using a nearest-neighbour classifier, the AI learns what information tends to lead to a purchase.

The AI is evaluated using 'true-positive-rate' and 'true-negative-rate' metrics.
